- The `ffmpeg` formula officially supplied by Homebrew
- An error with ffmpeg itself (use [trac.ffmpeg.org](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/) to file a bug, or the [`ffmpeg-user` mailing list](https://ffmpeg.org/contact.html#MailingLists))

**Please note we will close your issue without comment if you delete, do not read or do not fill out the issue checklist below and provide ALL the requested information.**
